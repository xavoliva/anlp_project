* Review papers on polarization for document classification
  * <https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/>
  * thought: if we compare words polarized subreddits, we cannot assess if these subreddits more polarized
  * we can use
    * 1) terms that are considered polarized (Hofmannm, Ddemsky)
    * 2) terms characterizing two poles (tf-idf, semaxis, partisan tokens (Ddemsky))
* Find events that can cause polarization
  * <https://www.history.com/news/2010s-decade-major-events>
  * Black Lives Matter - started in 2013
  * Mass Shootings - Las Vegas 2017, Orlando nightclub 2016
  * 2016 election
  * MeToo - 2017
  * Brexit?

* Find subreddits that are especially polarized
