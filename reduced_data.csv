32,Sybles,"which would be an example of trying to help other countries so doesnt that work more for my point than yours ? correct me if im wrong , but the impression i got from your response that there is no complication in forfeiting contributions to americans to instead help those of greater need like those who live third world lifestyles , because political issues make it doubtful that the contributions will actually be effective . my response is that there are plenty of examples of effective organizations that prove this is a real , effective option , so the complication for the purely utilitarian perspective remains . i dont see you complaining about the ultra rich not donating 99 of their income to charity . i dont think they necessarily should , or anyone for that matter . but for those who want to be purely utilitarian , it is a legitimate question . once again just because something is worse somewhere else does not mean the situation being bad here is okay or not worth talking about . i absolutely agree , but it does mean that each first world dollar is more needed and will bring more benefit for those in the third world . so if we are making policy based on needs , why give the money to those who need it less before those who need it more ? is a thief not a criminal because someone else is a murderer ? has nothing to do with any point i am making whatsoever . seriously go tell the 9 year old kids dying of cancer that at least they didnt die at 5 in a third world country and are terrible people for being even remotely upset about it . actually , while i think you should do a reasonable amount of personal effort to comfort a terminally ill child obviously parents friends even more so i find devoting tremendous resources to charities like the make a wish foundation to be the absolute worse use of millions of dollars that would probably ease more absolute pain and suffering if given to pretty much any other charitable organization . but in no way am i saying that dying kids are terrible people for being even remotely upset about it .",2014-01-03,R
