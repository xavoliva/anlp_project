## Project Proposal

Really interesting project! I really like the aspect here of trying to identify the events that are instigators of increasing polarization. One open question here is how you will measure "polarization" -- the method you described (using semaxis to situate words along a political continuum) provides a measure for how politically oriented individual words are, but it's both not clear a.) that should be the unit of analysis (is it really the *meaning* of words that you're looking at, or the totality of discourse in a given comment -- which would suggest a document-level prediction task and b.) that a word having increasing orientation toward one pole or another should define "polarization" rather than just stronger alignment with one or the other political party.  "Polarization" and "radicalization" both suggest a phenomenon that's divisive.  I'd also recommend situating this within several hypotheses that you can test -- e.g., specific events that you have reason to believe have led to increasing polarization (such as through news articles or academic articles that have argued so), and you can carry out an experiment here to test the degree to which it has done so in this data. I look forward to seeing where this goes!

For the midterm report (due Nov. 2), we'd like to see from all projects:

-- A thorough description of related work and how your proposed methods fit in to it.
-- All of the data should ideally be collected.
-- A few preliminary experiments to test whether your proposed methods are likely to be feasible or if they need adjustment.
-- Detail an evaluation strategy for assessing the performance on your method.
